### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
This time it went a lot more smoothly. I couldn't find the "Wonder Woman" when I mimicked Tim's code for the Superheroes gallery so I used the suggested API for similar movies in the Assignment steps.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Working on a macbook where I am completely unfamiliar with the iOS platform, also completely unfamiliar with xcode. I've found that I had start a new project and xcode was completely buggy and laggy-but finally started working so I'm not sure what made it better. I also found that the videos and directions on the page were a little unjointed and not reflective of newer versions. On top of that, I've reached out on Slack but there was no resolvement on Slack. It's quite difficult to do this remotely without having help. I spent about 2 days doing this. Next, I had issues with github, I followed the github desktop video but it went backwards instead. I can throw files on my pc via github for my classes but I'm unfamiliar with the process on a mac.
